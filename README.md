# CS_615_FinalProject
We will be exploring an ML colorization model with different BTC block size preprocessing steps that may help facilitate better colorization.

## Necessary Libraries:
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `sklearn` (sci-kit learn)

## Running on Linux Environment (with good hardware)
- `python3 src/model_build.py`
    - If you would like to modify the blocksize of the BTC, change the hyperparameter at the beginning of the file
